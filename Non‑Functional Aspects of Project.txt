🌟 Non‑Functional Aspects of Projects
Sometimes it is not just what you build, but how it behaves.

When I was preparing for placements, I thought projects were only about features building login pages, CRUD operations, or dashboards. But during my internship, I realized interviewers also care deeply about the non‑functional aspects of projects.

In my internship, mentors often reminded me the project is not complete until it is reliable, scalable, and secure. 
That hit me hard. I had focused only on functionality before, but in interviews, questions came around performance, scalability, and maintainability.

How I Managed?

-Performance: How fast does the application respond? Optimizing queries, caching, and reducing API calls matter.
-Scalability: Can the project handle more users or data without breaking? Interviewers wants to hear about modular design and microservices.
-Security: Beyond JWT, think about input validation, encryption, and other security frameworks.
-Maintainability: Is the code clean, documented, and easy to extend? This shows the best practices using sonarcube.
-Deployment: Hosting, uptime, monitoring these prove you understand real‑world systems.

What I have learned from my internship from Mentors:

-Always mention how you tested performance (like JUnit, Mockito and load tests).
-Show that you thought about error handling and logging.
-Explain how you ensured security beyond just authentication.
-Highlight how you structured code so others can maintain it.

These tips made me realize: interviewers are not just checking if you can code — they’re checking if you can build systems that last.

Rejections taught me to improve functionality. Internships taught me to value non‑functional aspects. Together, they shaped me into a better developer.

So to every student preparing for interviews:
👉 Don’t just show what your project does. Show how well it performs, scales, and adapts.

Because in the end, every “No” prepares you for the “Yes” that truly matters.
