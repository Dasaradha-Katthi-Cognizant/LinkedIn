Explore the things that excite you more

During my college days, I started coding in C++ because thats what everyone around me was following. I am not ready to explore beyond it, so I just stuck to the same path.

But the truth when you explore different technologies, you discover what truly excites you and keeps you curious.

💡Its not about the programming language itself, its about the technology that makes learning interesting.

In my case, I shifted completely from C++ to Java. Slowly, I began solving DSA problems using Java at first it was difficult but when I understand the concept and logic it souds good.

Then the real Game Started....

📌 During my internship at Cognizant, I was assigned Java Fullstack development Stream. This was a big change because in college I had built projects using React and Node.js.

So, what changed? 

When I started experimenting, I realized the importance of understanding how architecture and logic work inside a system. Thats when real learning happens.

🔥The mindset of “always be ready to learn anything” is what keeps you growing and puts you at the top.

✨ Some tips from my journey:

🛠️ Don’t just learn languages — build projects with advanced concepts.

🌐 Once you build projects, learn how to deploy applications.

🎯 Keep exploring until you find what excites you the most.
