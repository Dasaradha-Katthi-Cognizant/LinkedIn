🌟 My Cognizant OnCampus Interview Experience

I never shared this before, but I felt this is the right time to share.

My journey... started with many rejections from different companies during college placements. 
Each rejection did not fall me instead, it gave me the boost to prepare harder and crack the next opportunity.

Finally, I received a mail from my college: “You have been shortlisted for the interview.” I had 5 days to prepare.

How I planned?

-Resume played the key role so most questions came directly from it.

-My resume highlighted Core Java and React.js projects.

-The interview started with projects, then moved into OOPs and Collections.

-I explained concepts like Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Inheritance with real‑time examples. I am implemented it as well.

-The interview is around 40–50 minutes covering projects, certifications, languages, OOPs, code implementation, and collections.


When I walked out, I felt confiden and within a month, I joined Cognizant as an Intern.

This journey taught me that rejections are not failures, they are redirections. Every “No” prepared me for the “Yes” that mattered.

🤝 I will continue sharing my experiences, learning plans, roadmaps, and placement journey.
