🌟 Everyone dreams of landing an internship at a product‑based company during college. 



 It feels like a stamp of being at the top. I was no different.

📖 Back in my 2nd year, I applied to internships at Google and Amazon. 

 The result? Not shortlisted. Why? My resume lacked the right skills, projects, mentorship, hackathon experience — the essentials that make you stand out.



⏩ Now? 



 Fast forward to today my resume has been shortlisted for the Google Apprenticeship 2026. What changed?



 ✅ Upskilling consistently 

 ✅ Project‑based internships 

 ✅ Earning certificates that validate my learning 

 ✅ Building real‑time projects that show practical impact



📌 But the real truth behind resume shortlisting:



📝 Make your resume ATS‑friendly (Applicant Tracking System).

🎯 Align it with the job description and use relevant keywords.

💼 Highlight internships and real‑time projects  they carry more weight 

than just courses.



💡 Tools that helped me:



📄 Overleaf → perfect for professional resume formatting.

🤖 AI tools → to check ATS scores and optimize keywords.



👉 If you’re aiming for product‑based internships, remember: it’s not just about applying, it’s about showing proof of skills through projects, hackathons, and internships.



🤝 I will be sharing my experiences, guidance, learning plans, roadmaps, mentorship, and placement journey  if you are interested, let’s connect and grow together.
