🌟 What you are doing now is someones dream to achieve

There were days I felt stuck.  
Stressed.  
Unmotivated.  
Worried about placements.  
Disappointed after not cracking an interview.  

But then I reminded myself
What I am doing now is already someone else's dream.
Even reaching this point is a milestone others are still working toward.  

💬 Whether you are learning to code, preparing for interviews, or building your first project you are already on a path that inspires someone.  

So I chose to believe in myself.  
I focused on what truly matters in tech:  
- Building real things  
- Staying consistent  
- Learning with purpose  

🎯How I managed college and freelancing together:
 
1️⃣ Worked as an SME at Chegg
2️⃣ Trained AI models as an LLM trainer across platforms like outlier, G2i.
3️⃣ Built and delivered client projects via LinkedIn and now
4️⃣ I am Offering mentorship through TopMate

💡 The journey isn’t always smooth, but it’s always worth it.  
Stay consistent. Keep building. Believe in your path.  

🤝 I’ll continue sharing my experiences, learning plans, roadmaps, and placement journey.  
If you’re on a similar path — let’s connect and grow together! 🚀
